                    <p>Boston City Hall is a textbook case of brutalist architecture. Completed in 1968 to replace an aging city hall that was in use since 1865, the structure was considered a modern upgrade. The design was selected from a pool of entries in a two-stage competition held in 1962. The winning designer was Gehard Kallman, a Columbia University professor. The design was selected because the pure geometric forms and open spaces expressed the internal functions of the building. A succesful interpreation of brtualism arcitecture undoubtely, however the building has also genereated some criticisms since its completeion. Some see the dark swaths of concrete and sharp edes as intimidating and imposing. In 2008, it was voted the "World's Ugliest Building" in an online poll by virtualtourist.com.</p>
