                     <h2>What is <i>Brutalism</i>?</h2>
                     <p>Brutalism is an architectural style that flourished worldwide in the 1960s and early 1970s. The word itself comes from the French word 'beton brut', which translates to raw concrete. Brutalism is characterized by hulking slabs of unpainted concrete. The structures are imposing and bulky, fortress-like in nature with large walls and few windows.</p>
                     <h3>Prominence of Brutalism in the Boston area</h3>
                     <p class="newspaperColumns">As Brutalism gained popularity around the world, the architectural style found a foothold in the Boston area. Boston was considered an <i>old city</i> with meandering slums and blight. With an interest in modernizing the city, the Boston Redevelopment Authority reclaimed neighberhoods in a controversial urban renewal project during the 1950s and 1960s. This redevelopment leveled the West End and Scollay Square, leaving behind large swaths of pristine pavement to build upon. Builders swarmed on the opportunity of a lifetime. Numerous large concrete structures were erected in an effort to modernize the city. The rush to build left Bostonians with many brutalist structures that represent a thought-provoking time in architectural history and very few structures have been built in the style since.
